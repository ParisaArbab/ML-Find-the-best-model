# ML-Find-the-best-model

This code uses a machine learning approach to classify observations from the MAGIC Gamma Telescope dataset into two categories, labeled 'g' and 'h'. It employs the TPOT library to automatically find the best model and parameters for this task. The result will show the model's performance in correctly classifying these observations and the final chosen model with its specific settings. The exported script (pipeline.py) can then be used to apply this model to new telescope data for similar classification tasks.
